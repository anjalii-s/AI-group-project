This project applies Big Data analytics and Machine Learning to detect fraudulent Ethereum transactions. Using PySpark for distributed data processing and Spark ML for scalable model training, the pipeline demonstrates how fraud patterns can be identified in blockchain networks. The project also integrates SHAP explainability to highlight which features most influence fraud predictions.
